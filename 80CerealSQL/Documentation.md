<h3>Summary of Findings </h3>
<p>•  Background on dataset:The dataset contains 77 unique cereals, with no duplicates entries and no missing values. The Cereal with the lowest calories per serving is All-Bran With Extra Fiber at 50 calories per serving. The Cereal with the highest calories per serving is Mueslix Crispy Blend at 160 calories per serving. Kellogg is the dominating manufacturer, having the most cereal in the dataset. </p>
<p>• Nabsisco has the highest overall average rating among all manufacturers</p>
<p>•  General Mills stands out with the most number of cereals with a low rating. </p>
<p>•  So let’s talk about Shelf Location. According to insights from Frank Brogie over at Repsly.com, consumer behavior research indicates that the middle shelf, at eye level, is considered the prime placement for products in stores. Shoppers tend to favor products on this shelf compared to those positioned higher or lower. Drawing from my this and my own analysis, I’ve determined the middle shelf location (2) to be the optimal shelf placement. Upon evaluating the data, it is evident that Kellogg and General Mills stand out with the highest representation of cereals in this ideal middle section. On the contrary, American Home Food Products and Post exhibit the lowest presence of cereals in this preferred shelf location. </p>
<p>•  Cheerios has the highest protein content among cereals, providing 6g per serving. Meanwhile, 100% Natural Bran takes the lead in fat content with 5g per serving. In terms of carbohydrate content, Rice Chex ranks highest with 23g per serving. </p>
<p>• Top 5 cereals based on high ratings are </p>
<p>1. All-Bran with Extra Fiber 93.7</p>
<p>2. Shredded Wheat ‘n’ Bran 74.4 </p>
<p>3. Shredded Wheat Spoon Size 72.8</p>
<p>4. 100% Bran 68.4 </p>
<p>5. Shredded Wheat 68.2</p>
<p>•  Top 5 Cereals with the lowest rating are</p>
<p>1. Cap ‘n’ Crunch 18.0 </p>
<p>2. Cinnamon Toast Crunch 19.8 </p>
<p>3. Honey Graham Ohs 21.8</p>
<p>4. Count Chocula 22.3</p>
<p>5.  Cocoa Puffs 22.7 </p>
<p>•  Nutrient Correlation - While a direct correlation is not evident, it appears that cereals with higher protein content per serving might be associated with higher grams of fat. </p>
