<h3>Background and Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Danny loves Japanese Food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to open a restaurant that sells his 3 favorite foods: sushi, curry, and ramen. Help Danny answer a few questions about his customers in regards to visiting patterns, how much they’ve spent, and which menu items are their favorite. Danny also wants to use these insights to help decide whether or not he should expand the existing customer loyalty program. 3 Key Datasets that were shared: sales, menu, members. </p>
