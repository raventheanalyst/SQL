<h3> 📢 Introduction </h3>
<p>In this repository, I dive into SQL to manipulate, explore, and analyze data from datasets that unravel real-world business problems and datasets that, well, are just pretty damn interesting. These projects involve me writing complex queries and deriving meaningful insights. From simple aggregations to more advanced joins and subqueries. My aim is to showcase my proficiency in SQL and its application in solving real-world problems. SQL isn’t going anywhere… Don’t let anyone tell you differently 😉 </p>
